Installation

This distribution contains a ``lib`` sub-directory that includes the application
library files.

Use ``pip`` to automatically install the library:

    .. parsed-literal::

        pip install dxlfiletransferservice-\ |version|\-py2.py3-none-any.whl

Or with:

    .. parsed-literal::

        pip install dxlfiletransferservice-\ |version|\.zip

As an alternative (without PIP), unpack the
dxlfiletransferservice-\ |version|\.zip (located in the lib folder) and run the
setup script:

        python setup.py install
