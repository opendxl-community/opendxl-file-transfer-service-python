Overview
========

In conjunction with the
`File Transfer DXL Python client library <https://github.com/opendxl-community/opendxl-file-transfer-client-python>`_,
the File Transfer DXL Python service provides the ability to transfer files
via the `Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_
(DXL) fabric.

OpenDXL brokers are configured by default to limit the maximum size of a message
to 1 MB. The File Transfer DXL Python utilities allow the contents of a file to
be transferred in segments small enough to fit into a DXL message.

This package provides an application which registers a service with the DXL
fabric and a request callback which can store files sent to it. The
`File Transfer DXL Python client library <https://github.com/opendxl-community/opendxl-file-transfer-client-python>`_
library provides higher-level wrappers for client-side transmission of files.
