Samples Configuration
=====================

The File Transfer DXL Python service distribution contains a configuration file (``dxlclient.config``) located
in the ``sample`` sub-directory that must be populated in order for the samples to connect to the DXL fabric.

The steps to populate this configuration file are the same as those documented in the `OpenDXL Python SDK`, see the
`OpenDXL Python SDK Samples Configuration <https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/sampleconfig.html>`_
page for more information.

The following is an example of a populated configuration file:

   .. code-block:: python

       [Certs]
       BrokerCertChain=c:\\certificates\\brokercerts.crt
       CertFile=c:\\certificates\\client.crt
       PrivateKey=c:\\certificates\\client.key

       [Brokers]
       {5d73b77f-8c4b-4ae0-b437-febd12facfd4}={5d73b77f-8c4b-4ae0-b437-febd12facfd4};8883;mybroker.mcafee.com;192.168.1.12
       {24397e4d-645f-4f2f-974f-f98c55bdddf7}={24397e4d-645f-4f2f-974f-f98c55bdddf7};8883;mybroker2.mcafee.com;192.168.1.13
